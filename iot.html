							<p id="essay">The Internet of Things, it’s an interesting word I hear when people describe the future of where technology is going. This whole idea of interconnected devices that all speak to each other is a very empowering idea. Being able to walk into my house after a long day and all the lights turn on at a certain dimness and music starts playing some calm jazz music at a low volume. This is one of many scenarios I could see my life being affected by the internet of things. But what mostly excites me about the internet of things, is the fact that I could build my own products that incorporate it. As an aspiring entrepreneur, I see a huge opportunity for me to help build the next generation of great products in the world and see the idea of the internet of things really having influence in future products.<br><br>
The internet of things has many benefits, one is that it’s a way of connecting people and their products to create a more custom experience for the end user. I have a large passion for design and user experience and I can see where having “smart products” is a benefit for a custom user experience. This is important because when people really feel a connection with an easy to use product it creates a connection and experience the user won’t forget. A second benefit is that these “smart products” can save time, money, and frustration. If you have a light bulb that’s about to go out it should send you a text message before you get home saying “pick up a new light bulb” including information on best areas to buy the light based on price and quality reviews. As a result this saves frustration from when you get home and figure out your light doesn’t turn on.<br><br>
With benefits come threats or dangers. I think the biggest elephant in the room is security regarding internet of things products controlling home security. It is a very valid concern when you have the potential of hackers being able to unlock doors in your home. The way to deal with this remains unclear but there must be a way that we can innovate new security layers on these products to keep people safe.<br><br>
Overall there are more benefits than not and the world can leverage this to make a new impact on the lives of billions. This is a very exciting time in technology development and I am excited about the potential of the internet of things and the opportunities for businesses to change the world.
